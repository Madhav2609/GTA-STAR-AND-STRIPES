; GXT file of every language should contain GXT language key of each configured
; That`s because of posibility to show different name of language when language is switched.
; For example if 2 languages (American and Polish) are configured, whatever language is active
; it gets GXT language key of current GXT to display.
; therefore when spanish language is active, spanish language is "Espanol", when english, then "Spanish"

; Is is system metric - set to 1 if language should use metric scale such as meters (M).
; Set to 0 if you want imperial scale such as foots (FT to be used)

; Please remember a number of languages can`t exceed above 11 languages.
; It is because language loader hasn`t implemented multiple pages for languages while one page can contain 12 lines.
; One of line is already taken by "Back" button so that 11 lines of languages can be added.
